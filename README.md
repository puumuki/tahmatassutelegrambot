# Telegram Tahmatassu Bot

This is my introduction to the Tahmatassu Telegram Bot project. It's all about cooking recipes that I have tried and made by my self during the years.

Actual web page can be found from http://puumuki.game-server.cc

This bot uses web page REST API to fetch recipes from the server and 
servers them trough Telegram API to the end client at Telegram chat.
